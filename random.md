# GitHub Application

GitHub is a fundamental piece of open source software; it not only acts as the de-facto distribution platform for free and open projects but also comes equipped with some of the best collaboration tools that enable developers all over the world to work & communicate together like never before (RIP sourceforge). To work at GitHub would be to work in the best interest of the community at large, in my mind. It would be an opportunity to continue to do what I love doing, which is helping others (but at tremendous scale).
